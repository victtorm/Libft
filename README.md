# LIBFT

- Nowadays it is very easy to use functions that already exist, but it is very important, before using them, to know exactly how they work.

- Understanding the arguments, the output and when is the best case to use which function is not that simple, but at the end of this project I learn that.

- Basically in this project I learn how to create and improve my tools and functions and create my own path in programming.
