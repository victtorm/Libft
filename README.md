<h2> 🏁 Goals </h2>

- C programming can be very tedious when one dosen´t acess to highly useful standard fuctions. This project is about understanding the way these functions work, implementing and learning to use them.

- Understanding the arguments, the output and when is the best case to use which function is not that simple, but at the end of this project I learn that.

- Basically in this project I learn how to create and improve my tools and functions and create my own path in programming.
